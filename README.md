To run the teensy program the **Visual Micro** plugin for Visual Studio has to be installed, which means that the program can only be compiled on a Windows PC. 
The plugin can be installed from [here](https://www.visualmicro.com/) or by using the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualMicro.ArduinoIDEforVisualStudio).
